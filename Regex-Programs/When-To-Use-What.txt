When to use what?

✅ match → when you only care if the string starts with the pattern (like validating emails, phone numbers).

✅ search → when you need the first occurrence anywhere in the string.

✅ findall → when you need all matches (but just the values).

✅ finditer → when you need all matches with details (like positions, groups).
